Read and parse the input file: The first step is to read and parse the input file, which contains information about the landscape, such as its height, width, and elevation data for each point.

Create a 3D map: Based on the information in the input file, create a 3D map using points that represent the vertices of the landscape.

Project the map onto the screen: Project the 3D map onto the screen using a 2D projection algorithm such as isometric projection or perspective projection. This step involves converting the 3D coordinates into 2D coordinates that can be displayed on the screen.

Draw the wireframe: Draw the wireframe of the landscape on the screen using the projected 2D coordinates. This step involves connecting the vertices of the landscape with lines to create a wireframe representation of the landscape.

Handle user input: Implement the ability for the user to rotate, zoom, and move the landscape using keyboard and mouse input.

Add color: Add color to the wireframe to make it easier to interpret. This step involves using color gradients or other techniques to assign colors to different elevations of the landscape.

Bonus features: Add bonus features such as lighting effects, texture mapping, or other visual effects to make the wireframe more visually appealing.

Testing: Test the program thoroughly to ensure that it works correctly and handles edge cases appropriately.

Submission: Submit the project to the grading system and wait for feedback from your peers and instructors. Iterate on your code based on the feedback to improve the project.
